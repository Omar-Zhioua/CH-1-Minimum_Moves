# CH-1-Minimum_Moves
Trying to solve (using c#) the challenge:

You should build a console app where the user enters the square coordinates X and Y as inputs. 
The program should then find and draw the shortest path to reach the square on an infinite chessboard using the 'Knight' movements.

- The knight initially starts at position (0,0)
- Clearly the chess board is only infinite on the right and up sides (think of it as "repère orthonormée" with only positive values for X and Y axis)
- The output might be very big to be displayed in the terminal (it will look scrambled), so for each turn take a screenshot of the path and save it in a local folder.
